# Autonomous-Driving-Scene-Segmentation-with-U-Net
This project uses a U Net based deep learning model to perform pixel level semantic segmentation on CARLA simulator images. The goal is to classify each pixel of a driving scene into categories such as road, vehicles, pedestrians, buildings, vegetation, and background.
